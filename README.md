# Increasing Taxi Driver Income Through Understanding Customer Behavior
New York City's yellow taxis are experiencing a significant decline in customers due to business competition with technology-based transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft. Yellow Taxi Vendor asked the Data Analyst team to understand this phenomenon, as well as look for opportunities to get more customers. I used EDA methods as well as several data visualization techniques to understand the behavior of yellow cab customers. Based on the analysis carried out, I am able to provide recommendations in the form of effective work time management, recognizing factors that can encourage an increase in customers and income, and optimizing payment methods for customer convenience, and can have an impact on receiving tips as the main income support for yellow taxi drivers.
